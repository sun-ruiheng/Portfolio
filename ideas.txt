Add a link to the corresponding blog page for each project?

Make the background of the links change color a little on hover. The nav stuff too, like Blog, Contact. For UX

Instead of Contact, maybe call it About Me? Then I can have About Me section + contacts on that page.

In blog, each entry shouldn't have as long a height as each category in portfolio. People should be able to scroll comfortably and have a more
overview type look, so don't go too much into detail describing each one.

In blog, have different types of entries: experiences, skills, book reviews, personal.

Add logos next to CS, WD, P5
